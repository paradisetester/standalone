The PBM relies on its Cholesterol Best in Care drug management program to oversee utilization of both drugs. Prime has negotiated outcomes-based contracts with both PCSK9 manufacturers, including adherence and utilization cap components, the latter to protect Primeâ€™s clients from unanticipated increases in utilization. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care chose to cover only Repatha and has negotiated a pay-for-performance contract with Amgen, putting the manufacturer at financial risk. If Repatha does not lower LDL as promised by clinical trials, Amgen would have to provide an enhanced discount to Harvard Pilgrim members.Like Express Scripts and Prime, Harvard Pilgrim introduced a cap feature. Additional discounts are available if utilization of the drug exceeds certain levels. CVS Health also elected to cover just Repatha although it requires prior authorization.

      "description": "Spark Therapeutics will share risk with certain health insurers by paying rebates if patient outcomes for those using Luxturna fail to meet a specified threshold, linking payment for Luxturna to both short term-efficacy (30-90 days) and longer-term durability (30 months) measures that are unique to the one-time gene therapy. Short and long-term measures will be based on a full-field light sensitivity threshold (FST) testing score, with a baseline established for each eligible patient before administration of Luxturna. The company has entered into an agreement with commercial payers so that the payer/payers pharmacy purchases Luxturna rather than the treatment center. The Payer agrees to provide coverage for its members, expedite benefits processing and cap patient OOP amounts at in-network limits. The payer would also independently agree with the treatment center on reimbursement that is commensurate with the type of medical care required to deliver Luxturna. Spark Therapeutics assumes all drug in-transit, storage, and handling risks.",
