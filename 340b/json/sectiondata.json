Initially, all NPIs for covered entities\r\nenrolled in the Medicaid 340B program are excluded from rebate\r\nprocessing. Subsequently, a manual reconciliation process occurs\r\nwhereby the covered entity is provided a paid claims file for the\r\nprevious month. The covered entity is asked to validate the drugs are\r\nthat are 340B, and provide their 340B acquisition cost (AC). A financial\r\nsettlement occurs to ensure that Medicaid receives the AC. Anything\r\nidentified by the covered entity as non-340B eligible is then included\r\nfor rebate processing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, a pharmacy may submit the 340B AC on the claim using\r\nthe proper NCPDP submission codes (Submission Clarification Code\r\n\u201c20\u201d and Basis of Cost Determination\u201c08\u201d) for a 340B claim. All claims with 340B\r\nidentifiers are excluded from rebate processing.<\/p>","source":"Provider Communication March 2019, and supplemented by email correspondence with Director of Pharmacy Services,
