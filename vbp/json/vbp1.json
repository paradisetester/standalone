Throughout its contracts, the state emphasizes value-based purchasing as a “cornerstone” of its strategy to bend the upward trajectory of health care costs and health plans must participate in state-required VBP efforts across all programs. Arizona’s various VBP requirements are summarized below.\nAlternative Payment Model (APM) Initiative: In calendar year 2019, plans must meet the following APM targets, calculated as a percentage of total Medicaid expenditures. APMs are defined as Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network (HCP-LAN) APM Framework Categories 2B and higher.  \n*        Complete Care: 50%\n*       ALTCS E/PD: 50%\n*        ALTCS IDD sub-contractors for acute services: 38%, LTSS: 10%\n*        RBHAs: \n*        Integrated RBHAs for individuals with serious mental illness: 35%\n*        Non-integrated, behavioral-health-only RBHAs for other individuals with behavioral health needs: 20% \n\nThese targets increase over the next several years, as follows: \n*        AHCCCS Complete Care (new fully integrated program for adults and children in the Acute Care Program and CRS): \n*        CY 2020: 60%\n*        CY 2021: 70%\n*        ALTCS E/PD:\n*        CY 2020: 60%\n*        CY 2021: 70%\n*        ALTCS IDD:\n*        CY 2020: Sub-contractors for acute services: 50%, LTSS: 20%\n*        CY 2021: Sub-contractors for acute services: 60%, LTSS: 35%\n*        Integrated RBHAs for individuals with serious mental illness:\n*       CY 2020: 50%\n*        CY 2021: 60%\n*        Non-integrated RBHAs: \n*        CY 2020: 25%\n*        CY 2021: 25%\n\nIn addition to these APM targets, any Acute Care plans and RBHAs that are affiliated with one another must also enter into at least two APM contracts with integrated providers who offer physical and behavioral health clinical integration for members who are not already integrated under the Acute or RBHA contract but who receive their acute care or behavioral health services from these affiliated entities.\n\nPer the contracts, plans must submit annual APM certification files to the state, demonstrating their compliance or noncompliance with the APM targets. Failure to do so may result in disqualification from participation in the state’s withhold quality measure performance incentive program or the application of sanctions.\n\n* Withhold and Quality Measure Performance Incentive: The state also implements a 1% withhold program and a quality measure performance incentive program that are conditional upon plans meeting the APM targets. Plans failing to meet the APM targets will still have their withhold amount assessed, but will not be eligible for payment under the withhold or incentive programs. Earned withhold and incentive payments will be made to plans based on relative plan performance for the measurement year, as determined by the state. Under the incentive program, plans may receive additional funds over and above the capitation rates for implementing APM arrangements with providers “who successfully meet targets established by the plan that are aimed at quality improvement, such as reducing costs, improving health outcomes, or improving access to care.” \n \n* Value-Based Providers Initiative: Per the contract, plans must develop strategies that ensure that members are “directed to providers who participate in VBP initiatives and who offer value as \n   determined  by measureable outcomes.” Plans must submit annually to the state a “Value-Based Providers/Centers of Excellence” attachment to their Provider Network Development and Management \n   Plans,  describing their strategies to direct their members to high-value providers.\n\nArizona also permits its managed care plans to design and implement their own physician incentive programs, so long as the incentives are in line with federal requirements and are submitted to the state for approval prior to implementation. \n\nCitations: \nModel Contract:\n*        Section D: Complete Care Program Requirements, Paragraph 50.

VBP requirements across these models are largely aligned. In its\nMedicaid managed care contracts for each of these models, California allows—but does not\nrequire—plans to use alternative payment arrangements (e.g., capitation) with network providers\nand implement physician incentive plans, provided that they do so in compliance with federal\nregulations and state requirements described in the contracts.\n*  Two-Plan Model: Twenty-seven counties are designated to operate this model. In each\ncounty, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) contracts with one\ncounty-developed plan called a Local Initiative (LI) and one commercial plan.\n*  County Organized Health System (COHS): Twenty-one counties are designated to operate\nthis model. DHCS contracts with each county and each county operates its own managed\ncare plan.\n*  Regional Model: Nineteen counties are designated to operate this model, which is a slightly\nmodified version of the Two-Plan approach created for an expansion of Medicaid managed\ncare into rural counties. In this model, DHCS contracts with two commercial plans per\ncounty.\n*  Geographic Managed Care (GMC): Only Sacramento and San Diego counties are\ndesignated to operate this model. DHCS contracts with several commercial plans in these\ncounties.\n* Imperial Model: Only Imperial County is designated to operate this model, which involves\nDHCS contracting with two commercial plans.\n*  San Benito Model: Only San Benito County is designated to operate this model, which\ninvolves DHCS contracting with one commercial plan and Medi-cal beneficiaries having the\noption to enroll in this plan or stay in fee-for-service Medicaid.\nOutside its managed care contracts and as part of its 1115 demonstration, California is implementing\na delivery system transformation project called Public Hospital Redesign and Incentives in Medi-Cal\n\n(PRIME), in which success is measured by the increase in percentage of Medi-Cal managed care\npayments to public hospitals that are made through VBP arrangements. DHCS has called for 50% of\nthe Medi-Cal managed care enrollees assigned to a designated public hospital system to have all or\na portion of their costs of care paid through VBP arrangements by January 2018; this percentage will\nincrease to 55% in January 2019, and to 60% by 2020. Under the PRIME project, four tiers of\ncapitated payment and other alternative payment models are counted as VBP:\n1) partial capitation (primary care only); 2) “partial plus” capitation (primary care and some specialty\ncare, which can vary by contract); 3) global capitation (primary, specialty, ancillary and/or hospital\ncare); and 4) additional payment methodologies approved by the state and CMS.

While this deadline was not met, the most recent MassHealth\nMCO reprocurement cycle contract and delivery system reforms establishing provider-led\nMassHealth ACOs continues to support state efforts to expand APMs.\nThe MassHealth MCO model contract for the period starting March 2018 lays out a timeline for APM\nadoption requirements. Per the contract, a minimum proportion of each MCO’s members must\nreceive care under APMs as follows:\n* In contract years 1 and 2 (2018-2019): 60% must receive care under APMs\n* In contract years 3 and 4 (2020-2021): 70% must receive care under APMs\n* In contract year 5 (2022): 80% must receive care under APMs\nThe MassHealth MCO contract specifies how the state and MCO may consider a member to be\nreceiving care under an APM and includes specific reporting requirements. MCOs must provide the\nstate with the details of their payment methodologies, the algorithms and data used to associate\nmembers to an APM, records of payments made under APMs, and any other documentation that the\nstate requests.\n\nIn addition to the APM targets, the state is launching a new Medicaid ACO program in March 2018,\npart of the state’s latest 1115 waiver renewal authorized in 2016. There are three types of providerled MassHealth ACOs: (1) Partnership Plans (joint MCO and ACO prospective risk), (2) Primary Care ACOs (provider-only nearly full retrospective risk), and (3) MCO-Administered ACOs (limited\nACO retrospective risk with support from MCOs for care management). The MassHealth MCO\ncontract requires MCOs to contract with at least one MCO-Administered ACO, provided there is at\nleast one in the MCO’s region; such a contract counts toward the MCO’s APM coverage.\nThe Partnership Plan ACO agreement with the state most closely mirrors a managed care contract,\nwith the joint MCO-ACO venture (the Partnership Plan) assuming full risk for delivering a\ncomprehensive set of benefits to Medicaid managed care members, much like a traditional MCO.1\nThe Partnership Plan contract also includes requirements relating to financial accountability for the\nprovider-led ACO partner of the joint venture as well as risk-sharing with contracted primary care\nproviders (PCPs):\n* Financial accountability – Per the contract, the Partnership Plan must have a “financial\naccountability arrangement” where the MCO holds the ACO financially accountable for the\nperformance under this contract, with potential for the ACO to receive partial gains or losses.\nUnder such arrangement, the ACO’s maximum annual potential for losses or gains based on\nthe joint venture’s performance shall not be less than 5% of the joint venture’s risk-adjusted\nmedical component of the capitation rate for the contract year.\n* PCP-related VBP requirements – The contract also requires the Partnership Plans to:\no Hold PCPs or groups of PCPs financially accountable for performance—PCPs must\nhave the potential to share gains from savings or share financial responsibility for\nlosses, such that PCPs “experience a meaningful portion of their annual Medicaid\npatient service revenue opportunity tied to value-based performance measures”;\no Make value-based payments based on a performance measurement and\nmanagement process specified in the contract; and\no Reduce the influence of volume-based, fee-for-service incentives for PCPs.\nPartnership Plans must also submit progress reports that include a description of their value-based\npayments to PCPs, the size of the potential gains or losses for each PCP or PCP group, the actual\namount of performance-based gains or losses realized by such PCPs, and the results of the\nPartnership Plan’s performance measurement and management strategy for PCPs.\nPrimary Care ACOs contract directly with the state and have similar PCP risk sharing and reporting\nrequirements in their contract.

New York’s VBP Roadmap defines VBP by type of payment arrangement and\nlevel of risk, as depicted in the following table. \nPer the VBP Roadmap, plans must meet the following VBP targets:\n*  By April 1, 2018, at least 10% of plans’ total expenditures should be captured in “Level 1”\nVBP arrangements or higher.\n* By April 1, 2019:\n* At least 50% of plans’ total expenditures should be captured in “Level 1” VBP\narrangements or higher; and\no At least 15% of plans’ total expenditures should be captured in “Level 2” VBP\narrangements or higher.\n* By April 1, 2020:\n*  Between 80% and 90% of plans’ total expenditures should be captured in “Level 1”\nVBP arrangements or higher; and\n* At least 35% of plans’ total expenditures should be captured in “Level 2” VBP\narrangements or higher.\nPlans must report regularly on their VBP contracting and submit to the state provider subcontracts\nthat include VBP arrangements. The state reviews plans’ provider subcontracts based on the degree\nof provider risk included in the agreement, classifies each by VBP level, per the VBP Roadmap.\nIn addition to the VBP targets, New York implements three VBP-related adjustments to plans’\ncapitated rates to incentivize value-based contracting.\n* Stimulus Adjustment: To encourage plans to engage in higher levels of VBP and pass on\nmore risk to providers, plans will receive an upward “stimulus adjustment” on new Level 2 or\nLevel 3 VBP arrangements; these adjustments are based on plan-reported VBP survey\nresults. To qualify for stimulus adjustments, contracts must achieve greater than the 40th\npercentile in quality. Stimulus payments will end after State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019-2020.\n*  Penalty Adjustment: New York State is implementing a penalty or downward adjustment for\nplans that do not meet the VBP targets outlined in the state’s VBP Roadmap. Penalties are\nlevied on the value of the difference between the state’s VBP target and the plan’s\ncontracted amount; these adjustments are based on plan-reported VBP survey results.\n*  Performance Adjustment: Plans’ rates will also be adjusted—either upward or downward—\nbased on the relative quality and efficiency (measured by actual-to-expected cost ratio) per\nVBP arrangement (where upward adjustments will be made for contracts showing high\nquality and efficiency and downward adjustments will be made for contracts showing lower\nquality and efficiency). The state applies rate adjustments for both quality and efficiency to\nproduce one net performance adjustment score, so that plans may receive up to +/- 1% of\ntotal premium for each adjustment (+/- 2% total); this percentage may gradually increase\nover time. Plans will only be eligible for positive performance adjustments if contracts\nachieve greater than the 40th percentile in quality. The state sets targets for quality and\nefficiency based on historical data.\nFinally, New York administers a “VBP Innovator Program” for providers with experience taking risk.\nThe VBP Innovator Program is a voluntary program for providers prepared for enter into Level 2 and\nLevel 3 VBP arrangements. VBP Innovator providers are eligible for up to 95% of the total dollars\nthat have been traditionally paid from the State to plans.
