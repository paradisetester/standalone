The SPA permits the state to negotiate supplemental rebate agreements using a new “modified subscription” model that initially focuses on antiviral agents for hepatitis C and that promotes eliminating the hepatitis C virus statewide. This allows Louisiana to cap gross expenditures at a fixed amount for hepatitis C drugs, while providing the state with unlimited access to clinically necessary doses of these therapies for Medicaid beneficiaries. The supplemental rebate agreement applies to hepatitis C drugs dispensed both through Medicaid Managed Care Organizations and to fee-for-service beneficiaries in Medicaid, and all supplemental rebates collected will be paid to the state, not to Managed Care Organizations. The Louisiana Department of Health and Department of Corrections  announced that they have selected Asegua Therapeutics LLC, a subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc, as their hepatitis C subscription model pharmaceutical partner.

        "description": "In seeking an amendment to its 1115 demonstration, Massachusetts requested to waive the requirement under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act—the provision that regulates drug coverage and payment under Medicaid—that state Medicaid programs cover nearly every FDA-approved drug of a manufacturer that has signed the CMS rebate agreement. Massachusetts, however, sought to retain the requirement under Section 1927 that manufacturers pay minimum rebates to states, which must be at least 23.1% of the drug’s price for brand-name drugs and 13% for generics while imposing a formulary that restricts coverage for certain drugs. In effect, Massachusetts aimed to modify the existing accord between states and pharmaceutical manufacturers that Section 1927 established and through which manufacturers get guaranteed formulary placement of their drugs in exchange for states getting guaranteed discounts.",
