Unlike in other states where the corporate practice of medicine doctrine is primarily used as a sword between private parties to invalidate contractual arrangements or restrictions, the State of Iowa has been active in using the doctrine to prevent unauthorized legal persons from practicing certain professions. Unsurprisingly, in issuing its own opinions, the Office of the Attorney General has routinely upheld these decisions. Despite these general restrictions, the Iowa legislature has enacted provisions allowing certain entities to directly employ health care professionals.
