Unsurprisingly, in issuing its own opinions, the Office of the Attorney General has routinely upheld these decisions.

The projects are supported by the federal State Innovation Model (SIM) grant, which Oregon received to fund innovative projects that support the State's health care system transformation efforts. The five pilot projects included:\n\n1)  Adventist Health Tillamook Medical Group : Put high-speed data connectivity in each ambulance to support direct, real-time communication with the Rural Health Clinics (RHC). \n\n2)  Capitol Dental Care : Implemented telehealth-connected oral health teams to reach 1,500 children who have not been receiving dental care on a regular basis and to provide community-based dental diagnostic, prevention and early intervention services\n\n3)  HIV Alliance : Aimed to increase access to care for these persons in rural eastern and southern Oregon with collaborative practice agreements and telehealth technology; proactively engaged Pharmacists to be more directly involved with HIV specialists or primary care providers through collaborative practice agreements. \n\n4)  Oregon Health & Science University : Layton Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Center: Created a direct-to-home telemedicine program to: establish the reliability of standard measures of patient and caregiver well-being when used with telemedicine, and establish the feasibility and usability of direct-to-home video dementia care using telemedicine technology.\n\n5)  Trillium Family Services : Aimed to improve access to mental health services for vulnerable children in rural Oregon by providing psychiatric assessments, follow-up and medication management via telehealth for approximately 80 children each year discharged from SCIP and SAIP programs and approximately 300 children in rural school settings who cannot effectively access outpatient psychiatry services.
